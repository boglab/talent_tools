# Description

This directory contains the source code for the TALEN Targeter, Old TALEN Targeter, and TAL Effector Targeter tools from the [TALE-NT](https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu) website.

# Dependencies and Set Up

boglab_tools requires Python 2.6+ and [biopython](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/biopython).

By default the tools expect to be located at /opt/boglab/talent. Changing this requires editing 2 files:

1. In talconfig.py, change the value of BASE_DIR to the full path of the parent folder of boglab_tools
2. In findTAL.py find the line that says 'with open(BASE_DIR + "/talent/re_dict_dump", "rb") as re_dict_file:' and change 'talent' to 'boglab_tools'

Note that off-target counting with findTAL.py won't work unless [tfcount](https://github.com/boglab/tfcount) is installed, and findRvdTAL.py and findPairedRvdTALs.py won't work unless you install the C libraries and cython wrappers from [talesf](https://github.com/boglab/talesf) and [talesf/paired](https://github.com/boglab/talesf/tree/paired).

# Usage

Here's a mapping between the the tools on the site and the scripts in boglab_tools:

* TALEN Targeter - findTAL.py
* TALEN Targeter (old version with design guidelines) - findTAL_old.py
* TAL Effector Targeter - findSingleTALsite.py
* Target Finder - findRvdTAL.py
* Paired Target Finder - findPairedRvdTALs.py

You can run any of the scripts by doing:

```
python findTAL.py OPTIONS
```

You can find out what options exist for any of them by doing:

```
python findTAL.py --help
```

The command for running findTAL.py with the default parameters from the site is:

```
python findTAL.py --filter '0' --gspec --min '15' --max '30' --arraymin '15' --arraymax '20' --fasta 'filemx4P32.fasta' --outpath 'fileOgILYO.txt' --logpath '79637.log'
```

* --min and --max are the minimum and maximum spacer length
* --arraymin  and --arraymax are the minimum and maximum RVD sequence length
* --fasta is the path to the file containing your input sequences in [FASTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) format
* --gspec tells the script to use NH instead of NN for G
* --outpath is where you want the output file to go
* --logpath is the path to write the process log to; if you leave this out it will print this to stdout on your terminal

To search for off-target sites in a custom genome, run findTAL.py as above, but add the options '--offtargets --offtargets-fasta PATH_TO_CUSTOM_GENOME'
